### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently working as a Service Lead at FutuCare, taking care on our customers and making sure that everything flows smoothly for developers as well. Taking on some developer tasks next, so more tools to my toolbox to come.

Worked 1,5 years as a RPA developer with UiPath and made some awesome robots for our customers which are still saving money for them.

Participated in Mimmit Koodaa Hackathon 17.-19.9.2021 and reached 3rd place with my team. So exited! Cant't wait for the next time!

- âš¡ Fun fact: 2020: I just participated in my first ever Hackaton. It was exiting and very eye opening. There is so much I don't know yet. But I recommend these events to all who aspire to be better at anything! Thank You Level-up coders and Major League Hacking- Local hack day: Share. Currently I'm in position 542 with my 22 points (3.4. at 21.07 GMT+3), but I think that is ok for a first time. AND I still have some time to share! -Update- 2021: Now there has been another hackathon and in that my team came in third place, so progress :-)
