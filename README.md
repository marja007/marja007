- âš¡ Fun fact: I just participated in my first ever Hackaton. It was exiting and very eye opening. There is so much I don't know yet. But I recommend these events to all who aspire to be better at anything! Thank You Level-up coders and Major League Hacking- Local hack day: Share. Currently I'm in position 542 with my 22 points (3.4. at 21.07 GMT+3), but I think that is ok for a first time. AND I still have some time to share! -Update- Now there has been another hackathon and in that my team came in third place, so progress :-)
