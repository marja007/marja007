### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently, I am serving as a Service Specialist Developer at Rajobit Oy where I am responsible for ensuring the functionality and further development of clients' RPA solutions. Additionally, I have been involved in developing the internal validation process and implementing it in practice.

For a short period I worked as a Service Lead at Futurice FutuCare, where I successfully established strong communications and relationships with our customers. By understanding their needs, I helped them add value to their own customers, leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty. Although the work was very interesting I still wanted to revert back to RPA and thus ended up changing companies.

Before my role as a Service Lead, I worked as a RPA developer at Azets Insight Oy, where I was a vital member of our inhouse automation team. During this time, I developed UiPath robots for various departments, including payroll. Additionally, I led a project from planning to pilot, demonstrating my ability to effectively manage and deliver successful automation initiatives. Handling diverse tickets, ranging from user management to bug fixing in automations, has further enhanced my technical proficiency and problem-solving skills.

Participated in Mimmit Koodaa Hackathon 17.-19.9.2021 and reached 3rd place with my team.

2020: I just participated in my first ever Hackaton. It was exiting and very eye opening. There is so much I don't know yet. But I recommend these events to all who aspire to be better at anything! Thank You Level-up coders and Major League Hacking- Local hack day: Share. Currently I'm in position 542 with my 22 points (3.4. at 21.07 GMT+3), but I think that is ok for a first time. AND I still have some time to share! 
-Update- 
2021: Now there has been another hackathon and in that my team came in third place, so progress :-)
